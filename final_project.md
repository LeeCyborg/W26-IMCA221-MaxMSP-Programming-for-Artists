# 35%: Final Project
## Individual Project
#### Prototype: March 26
#### Final April 9
This is a completely open project. Students can make anything they want as long as it uses the tools we learned this semester. Be sure to have a clear and strong concept.
Think about how you want the audience to perceive your work and how you will evoke that feeling. What tools, materials, sounds, or visuals will you need? What do they say about your concept and work overall?
## Prototype:
Come to class with a prototype of wha you want to make. This should include some basic work in a patch and a clear idea of the final work. Bring:
- Work to show the class
- Questions to ask the class about how to realize the work
- A work plan and timeline
## Final:
- Be prepared to present November 25. Presentations will be 10-15 minutes depending on class size. Be ready to talk about your process, concept, and future directions.

## Grading Criteria:
__25% Exploration & Functionality:__ 
The goal of this grade is to help you push your boundaries but work within your capabilities. Having a more complex project is part of the grade, but it is more important that your work functions. Be intentional and spend time trying to understand your problems instead of abandoning things that don’t work. A good way to excel in this area is to explore a new technique we did not touch on in class OR expand meaningfully on something we touched on in class.
__25% Creativity & Concept:__  
Every project should have a concept. Concepts don’t have to be elaborate or in depth, they can be as simple as evoking a feeling, exploring a moment, explaining a subject or cause, sharing something you like, making the viewer feel something briefly. Keep your concepts simple as you start. This grade is measured by how effective your concept is on the viewer so don’t try anything complex when you start. Some really simple ideas: colours, nostalgia for a particular time, surprise, decontextualize a space, etc. As you get better at concepts, you can explore larger ideas. Always have a concept, no matter how simple. A good way to excel in this area is to have a clear concept that is evident to the viewers without explanation.
__25% Execution & presentation quality:__  
This is measured by how well presented your work is. This is aside from the creativity, but how well it is physically or digitally assembled. How would it look in a gallery? A good way to excel in this area is to make sure your work is polished and clean. This can vary widely depending on the work. Clean up your cables, good presentation, well made objects or assets etc.
__25% Documentation:__  
Project is documented as outlined below. Remember: if you don’t document your project, nobody else will know it happened! Handing in projects: 

## Deliverables 

Each project should include a .zip file that contains:
-  saved file (File > Save as Project) .maxpat 
- A PDF that contains project documentation.  See Project_Documentation_template on Moodle. It contains: 
- - A clear, strong image of your project. 
- - A screen capture of your max patch 
- - A link to video or audio recording of your project working (can be a video or a link to a private video on YouTube, Vimeo or Google) 
- - A 50-100 word explanation of your project inside your file Be sure to name files properly (no untitled-1.zip) All files are expected to be cleaned up and arranged in a reasonable, legible way. Videos should be clear, well light and show your project working. 


## Late Policy
All projects are expected to be handed in by midnight of the due date. Feel free to
make changes after critique or finish documentation. Students will be deducted
5%per day after that. If there is any reason why you can’t meet the deadline, notify
the
instructor via email or in class. The sooner you notify the instructor, the sooner they
can help you find a solution or avoid late marks. If you need help accessing student
